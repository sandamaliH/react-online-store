# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npx create-react-app online-store`

Direct into the project folder

### `cd online-store`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Development

1. STYLED COMPONENTS - Easier to add styles into any defined component even in the same class or define it in another place () and import to where you want the style regardless of styling classes.

To download styled-components run
### `npm install styled-components`

Note - No build step needed

### code example
const Button = styled.button`
    background: green;
    color: white;
`
If you want to add styles into a 
    - button it should be - styled.button
    - div it should be - styled.div

--------------------------------------------------

2.  REACT ROUTER

Install the package react router DOM version 5
### `npm i react-router-dom`

Create pages and component folders and import them to the App file in order to load the main page navigation

## Pages
Create all main pages inside the page folder and inside the pages/index.js file initialize all the inner pages
eg - AboutPage.js

## Components
Create all components inside the component folder and inside the component/index.js file initialize all the components there
eg - Navbar.js

--------------------------------------------------

3. Navbar

Install react icon module
### `npm install react-icons`
